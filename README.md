Google Code Jam 2015
===================

I participated in the google code jam this year. It was great fun! I ended rank ~1500 after the qualification round, solving three of the problems: Standing ovation, Dijkstra, and Ominous Omino. I didn't get the infinite house of pancakes, but that led to a great conversation with my algorithms professor afterwards. 

I had the help for at least two of these problems from my tremendous girlfriend [Carolyn Saund](https://github.com/csaund).
